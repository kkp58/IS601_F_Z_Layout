    <p>This highly specialized writing intervention series targets middle school students with learning differences
        who have not been successful in conventional language arts programs. The series’ step-by-step approach
        builds writing competency from the ground up—students learn to edit, format, and build paragraphs while
        mastering 4 basic writing strands required in regular English and content area classes and standards-based
        state tests. By the end of the book, students are writing complete essays. Lively writing, illustrations,
        and a systematic approach make this series easy to teach and to use.The HTML element represents a paragraph.
        Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank
        lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content,
        such as images or form fields.</p>
